## Project Portfolio

## Project 1: Daytime Heart Rate Insights to Predict Sleep Stages with Fitbit Data

### Description

This project aims to predict sleep stages using data from Fitbit wearables. The Fitbit dataset contains records of 30 participants, capturing metrics such as heart rate recorded every second, sleep metrics, and step metrics. A key focus of this study is to analyze heart rate variations throughout the day and its potential impact on sleep stages. By understanding how heart rate fluctuates during different times of the day, this project tries to find patterns that might inform the quality of rest a person gets at night. The idea is that elevating your heart rate at certain times during the day could potentially lead to better rest during the night.

The FitBit Fitness Tracker Data datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. All data discussed below represents these 30 participants over this two-month period. The project also aims to explore the individual differences in heart rate and sleep patterns, providing insights into personalized strategies for optimizing rest.

### Dataset
**FitBit Fitness Tracker Data:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data)

Below are the total rows of each dataset used:  

`heartrate_seconds_num_rows = 2483658`  

`minuteSleep_num_rows = 188521`  

`minuteSteps_num_rows= 1325580`  
    
### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization) 
- Numpy

### Techniques Applied and How They Were Used

#### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Null Value and Data Type Check**
    ```python
    # Checked for any Null values and inconsistent datatypes across all datasets
    ```

- **Datetime Formatting**
    ```python
    minuteSleep['date'] = pd.to_datetime(minuteSleep['date'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
    heartrate_seconds['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(heartrate_seconds['Time'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
    minuteSteps['ActivityMinute'] = pd.to_datetime(minuteSteps['ActivityMinute'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
    ```
    Datetime columns were converted to a consistent format for easier handling and manipulation.

- **Column Renaming**
    ```python
    heartrate_seconds.rename(columns={'Time': 'date'}, inplace=True)
    minuteSteps.rename(columns={'ActivityMinute': 'date'}, inplace=True)
    heartrate_seconds.rename(columns={'Value': 'Heart Rate'}, inplace=True)
    minuteSleep.rename(columns={'value': 'SleepStage'}, inplace=True)
    ```
    Columns were renamed to maintain consistency and clarity across datasets.

- **Column Removal**
    ```python
    minuteSleep.drop(columns=['logId'], inplace=True)
    ```

- **Data Resampling**
    ```python
    heartrate_minutes = (
        heartrate_seconds
        .groupby(['Id', heartrate_seconds['date'].dt.floor('T')]) 
        .agg({'Heart Rate': 'mean'})
        .reset_index()
    )
    ```
    Heart rate data was resampled from seconds to minutes granularity to reduce dataset size and improve manageability.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualization of Heart Rate Data Per Hour Over a Month Period**
    ```python
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))
    for individual in sampled_individuals:
        individual_data = hourly_data[hourly_data['Names'] == individual]
        plt.plot(pd.to_datetime(individual_data['Date'].astype(str) + ' ' + individual_data['Hour'].astype(str) + ':00:00'), 
                 individual_data['Avg Heart Rate Per Minute'], 
                 label=individual)
    ```
    This code was used to generate a visualization showcasing the average heart rate per hour for randomly sampled individuals.

    ![alt text](https://github.com/conorbrooke77/Data-Science-ML-Project/blob/main/Average%20Heart%20Rate%20Per%20Hour%20for%20Sampled%20Individuals.png?raw=true)  

    **Basic Statistical Summary for Sampled Individuals:**

    Mean (Average) Heart Rate: 69.52 beats per minute  
    Standard Deviation: 15.19  
    Minimum Heart Rate: 36.8 beats per minute  
    Maximum Heart Rate: 187.0 beats per minute  
    Median (50th percentile) Heart Rate: 66.43 beats per minute  
    25th Percentile: 59.40 beats per minute  
    75th Percentile: 75.80 beats per minute  

- **Visualization of Heart Rate Data Per Hour For A Sample User**
    ```python
    # Filter for a specific date for Joe
    specific_date = "2016-04-13"
    joe_data = hourly_data[(hourly_data['Names'] == 'Joe') & (hourly_data['Date'] == specific_date)]

    # Plotting the data for Joe
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))
    plt.plot(pd.to_datetime(joe_data['Date'].astype(str) + ' ' + joe_data['Hour'].astype(str) + ':00:00'), 
    joe_data['Avg Heart Rate Per Minute'], 
    label='Joe', color='blue')
    ```
    This code was used to generate a visualization showcasing the average heart rate per hour for randomly sampled individuals.

    ![alt text](https://github.com/conorbrooke77/Data-Science-ML-Project/blob/main/Joe%20Daily%20Heart%20Rate%20analysis.png?raw=true)  

    **Basic Statistical Summary for Joe on 2016-04-13:**

    Mean (Average) Heart Rate: 60.59 beats per minute  
    Standard Deviation: 4.33  
    Minimum Heart Rate: 51.77 beats per minute  
    Maximum Heart Rate: 68.47 beats per minute  
    Median (50th percentile) Heart Rate: 61.51 beats per minute  
    25th Percentile: 57.65 beats per minute  
    75th Percentile: 63.30 beats per minute  

- **Visualization of Sleep Stages Distribution**
    ```python
    total_minutes_per_stage = sleep_duration.groupby('SleepStage')['Duration_minutes'].sum()
    total_minutes = total_minutes_per_stage.sum()
    percentage_per_stage = (total_minutes_per_stage / total_minutes) * 100
    percentage_per_stage.plot(kind='bar', color=['blue', 'green', 'red'])
    plt.title('Percentage of Time Spent in Each Sleep Stage')
    plt.ylabel('Percentage (%)')
    plt.xlabel('Sleep Stage')
    plt.show()
    ```
    This code was used to generate a visualization of Sleep Stages Distribution. The data is highly unlikely and may be inaccurate.

#### 3. Feature Engineering

- **Time Data Splitting**
    ```python
    heartrate_minutes_split_time = heartrate_minutes['DateTime'].str.split(' ', expand=True)
    ```
    The DateTime column was split into separate date and time components for more granular analysis.

- **Usernames Association**
    ```python
    heartrate_minutes['Names'] = heartrate_minutes['Id'].map(id_to_name)
    ```
    Random names were associated with user IDs for clearer and more human-readable data visualization.

- **Sleep Stage Mapping for Readability**
    ```python
    sleep_stages = {
        1: 'Awake',
        2: 'REM',
        3: 'Deep Sleep'
    }
    # Apply the mapping to the 'SleepStage' column
    minuteSleep['SleepStage'] = minuteSleep['SleepStage'].replace(sleep_stages)
    ```

- **Calculating Sleep Duration per Sleep Stage**
    ```python
    minuteSleepCopy['day'] = minuteSleepCopy['date'].dt.date
    sleep_duration = minuteSleepCopy.groupby(['Id', 'day', 'SleepStage']).size().reset_index(name='Duration_minutes')
    ```
    ![alt text](https://github.com/conorbrooke77/Data-Science-ML-Project/blob/main/Daily-SleepDuration.png?raw=true) 

- **Understanding Sleep Data Consistency**
    ```python
    total_sleep = minuteSleepCopy.groupby(['Id', 'day']).size().reset_index(name='Total_minutes')
    # Merge total_sleep with sleep_duration
    sleep_duration = sleep_duration.merge(total_sleep, on=['Id', 'day'])
    # Calculate the percentage
    sleep_duration['Percentage'] = (sleep_duration['Duration_minutes'] / sleep_duration['Total_minutes']) * 100
    ```
    ![alt text](https://github.com/conorbrooke77/Data-Science-ML-Project/blob/main/Percentage-Sleep.png?raw=true)  

    Completely inaccurate or misunderstood data, as its highly unlikely to stay awake 94% of each day for a month.

### Data Processing Techniques

The data, sourced from Fitbit (Fitabase), presented potential biases due to its limitation to 30 participants. The third-party nature of the collection method further raised issues. Addressing these challenges required several processing techniques:

- Datetime formatting was changed for consistency.
- Heart rate data had to be resampling to a minute granularity, reducing the dataset's size for manageability.
- Feature engineering split date and time for clearer time-series data interpretation.
- Data cleaning saw the removal of non-essential columns and renaming for clarity e.g, logid column which had inconsistent data and didn't correlate across datasets.

### Opportunities from the Project

- Delve into the relationship between heart rate and sleep stages, offering insights into potential sleep stage predictions using Fitbit data.
- Acquire hands-on experience with real-world datasets.
- Improve understanding of time-series data.

### New Technologies Learned

- Practice with Pandas for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- Visualization techniques, particularly with Matplotlib.

### Datasets Explored

- **heartrate_seconds**: Captured heart rates every second.
- **minuteSleep**: Documented sleep metrics every minute.
- **minuteSteps**: Recorded steps metrics every minute.

### Skills Acquired

- Better understanding of time-series data analysis.
- Basic skills in data cleaning.
- Feature engineering within date-time data.
- Practise with visualization of time-series data.

### Challenges Faced

- Merging posed challenges due to the extensive dataset sizes, had many problems finding ways to merge data beneficially while staying coherent.
- Due to merging challenges and the limited number of participants, establishing a connection between the heart rate and sleep stages data proved to be incredibly frustrating.
- The MinuteSleep data was hard to differentiate between daytime and nighttime hours, making it either inaccurate or I struggled to interpret it correctly.
- Formatting on the steps data was also a challenge to interpret, along with having what seemed like a pointless column.
- Differing granularities between datasets causing resampling of datasets.
- The dataset's potential biases came from a limited participant count and third-party collection methods, eventhough datasets are large the data stays quite consistent.
- The MinuteSleep data, based on the percentage analysis, is inconsistent and inaccurate. This has led to challenges in interpreting the data correctly.
- In-depth analysis of sleep stages showed that users spent an unusually high percentage of time being "Awake", raising concerns about the reliability of this dataset.

### Modeling Roadblocks

Haven't begun modeling for Iteration 1.

### Conceptual Hurdles

- Have to get a better grasp on the aspects influencing sleep stages.
- Understading the relationship between heart rate and sleep aswell as physical activity on sleep, especially considering the inconsistencies present in the sleep data.

### Disappointing Conclusion

I tried to use Fitbit data to understand sleep patterns. But I ran into problems.
The main issue was with the `minuteSleep` dataset. It didn't seem right. For example, it showed that users were "Awake" a lot more than expected. This makes us question if the data is good or not. The `minuteSteps` dataset also didn't have enough useful data to re-orintate the goal to a prediction using physical activity.
Because of these issues, I might need to change my approach. Maybe I'll look at the data hour by hour next time. Or use a totally different dataset.
Even though I faced challenges, I learned a lot. I found out how important it is to double-check my data. I hope to find better dataset for the second iteration.
