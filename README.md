## Project Portfolio

# Project 1: Predicting Sleep Stages using Fitbit Data

## Description:
A machine learning project aimed at predicting sleep stages (deep, light, REM, awake) based on minute-level heart rate and physical activity data collected from Fitbit devices. The project explores the relationship between daily activities, heart rate patterns, and sleep quality, aiming to provide insights into factors affecting sleep and potential recommendations for improving sleep quality.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- (TensorFlow or PyTorch if deep learning models are employed)

## Techniques Applied:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Modeling (classification)
- Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning

## Data Processing Techniques:
- Normalization (Scaling features to a similar range)
- Encoding (Transforming categorical variables into numerical representations)
- Handling missing values (imputation, deletion, etc.)
- Aggregation (Creating daily summaries from minute-level data, if necessary)

## Opportunities from the Project:

### New Technologies Learned:
- Exploration of advanced machine learning libraries (if any)
- Understanding and applying time-series analysis techniques (if applicable)

### Datasets Explored:
- Fitbit's minute-level heart rate and physical activity data
- Investigating the challenges and intricacies of health-related time-series data

### Skills Acquired:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time-series analysis
- Machine learning model development, evaluation, and tuning

## Challenges Faced:

### Data Challenges:
- Merging datasets with different granularity and identifiers
- Handling missing or inconsistent data

### Modeling Roadblocks:
- Selecting the appropriate machine learning models for multi-class classification
- Balancing the dataset if there's class imbalance among sleep stages

### Implementation Barriers:
- Integrating the predictive model into a user-friendly interface (if applicable)

### Conceptual Hurdles:
- Understanding the physiological factors affecting sleep stages
- Interpreting the model's predictions in a meaningful way

## Sample Screenshots:
Visualization1: (e.g., Distribution of sleep stages)
Visualization2: (e.g., Heart rate patterns across different sleep stages)

## Ethical Considerations:
- Ensuring the privacy and anonymity of individuals whose data was used
- Understanding the limitations of the model and the potential implications of its predictions on individual's sleep health recommendations
