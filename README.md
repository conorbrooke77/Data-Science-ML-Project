## Project Portfolio

## Project 1: Predicting Sleep Stages using Fitbit Data

### Description

This project aims to predict sleep stages using data from Fitbit wearables. The Fitbit dataset contains records of 30 participants, including metrics like heart rate recorded every second, sleep metrics, and steps metrics. This study focuses on analyzing the heart rate and its relation to sleep stages to make effective predictions. The FitBit Fitness Tracker Data datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. All the data below is representitive of these 30 participants over this two month period.

### Dataset
**FitBit Fitness Tracker Data:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data)

Below are the total rows of each dataset used:  

`heartrate_seconds_num_rows = 2483658`  

`minuteSleep_num_rows = 188521`  

`minuteSteps_num_rows= 1325580`  
    
### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization) 
- Numpy

### Techniques Applied and How They Were Used

#### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Null Value and Data Type Check**
    ```python
    # Checked for any Null values and inconsistent datatypes across all datasets
    ```

- **Datetime Formatting**
    ```python
    minuteSleep['date'] = pd.to_datetime(minuteSleep['date'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
    heartrate_seconds['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(heartrate_seconds['Time'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
    minuteSteps['ActivityMinute'] = pd.to_datetime(minuteSteps['ActivityMinute'], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
    ```
    Datetime columns were converted to a consistent format for easier handling and manipulation.

- **Column Renaming**
    ```python
    heartrate_seconds.rename(columns={'Time': 'date'}, inplace=True)
    minuteSteps.rename(columns={'ActivityMinute': 'date'}, inplace=True)
    heartrate_seconds.rename(columns={'Value': 'Heart Rate'}, inplace=True)
    minuteSleep.rename(columns={'value': 'SleepStage'}, inplace=True)
    ```
    Columns were renamed to maintain consistency and clarity across datasets.

- **Data Resampling**
    ```python
    heartrate_minutes = (
        heartrate_seconds
        .groupby(['Id', heartrate_seconds['date'].dt.floor('T')]) 
        .agg({'Heart Rate': 'mean'})
        .reset_index()
    )
    ```
    Heart rate data was resampled from seconds to minutes granularity to reduce dataset size and improve manageability.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualization of Heart Rate Data Per Hour Over a Month Period**
    ```python
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))
    for individual in sampled_individuals:
        individual_data = hourly_data[hourly_data['Names'] == individual]
        plt.plot(pd.to_datetime(individual_data['Date'].astype(str) + ' ' + individual_data['Hour'].astype(str) + ':00:00'), 
                 individual_data['Avg Heart Rate Per Minute'], 
                 label=individual)
    ```
    This code was used to generate a visualization showcasing the average heart rate per hour for randomly sampled individuals.

    ![alt text](https://github.com/conorbrooke77/Data-Science-ML-Project/tree/Data-Science-ML-Project/Average-Heart-Rate-Per-Hour-for-Sampled-Individuals.png?raw=true)  

    **Basic Statistical Summary for Sampled Individuals:**

    Mean (Average) Heart Rate: 69.52 beats per minute
    Standard Deviation: 15.19
    Minimum Heart Rate: 36.8 beats per minute
    Maximum Heart Rate: 187.0 beats per minute
    Median (50th percentile) Heart Rate: 66.42857142857143 beats per minute
    25th Percentile: 59.40 beats per minute
    75th Percentile: 75.80 beats per minute

- **Visualization of Heart Rate Data Per Hour For A Sample User**
    ```python
    # Filter for a specific date for Joe
    specific_date = "2016-04-13"
    joe_data = hourly_data[(hourly_data['Names'] == 'Joe') & (hourly_data['Date'] == specific_date)]

    # Plotting the data for Joe
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))
    plt.plot(pd.to_datetime(joe_data['Date'].astype(str) + ' ' + joe_data['Hour'].astype(str) + ':00:00'), 
    joe_data['Avg Heart Rate Per Minute'], 
    label='Joe', color='blue')
    ```
    This code was used to generate a visualization showcasing the average heart rate per hour for randomly sampled individuals.

    ![alt text](https://github.com/conorbrooke77/Data-Science-ML-Project/tree/Data-Science-ML-Project/Joe-Daily-Heart-Rate-analysis.png?raw=true)  

    **Basic Statistical Summary for Joe on 2016-04-13:**

    Mean (Average) Heart Rate**: 60.59 beats per minute
    Standard Deviation: 4.33
    Minimum Heart Rate: 51.775370370370375 beats per minute
    Maximum Heart Rate: 68.47461640211641 beats per minute
    Median (50th percentile) Heart Rate: 61.51015512265512 beats per minute
    25th Percentile: 57.65 beats per minute
    75th Percentile: 63.30 beats per minute



#### 3. Feature Engineering

- **Time Data Splitting**
    ```python
    heartrate_minutes_split_time = heartrate_minutes['DateTime'].str.split(' ', expand=True)
    ```
    The DateTime column was split into separate date and time components for more granular analysis.

- **Usernames Association**
    ```python
    heartrate_minutes['Names'] = heartrate_minutes['Id'].map(id_to_name)
    ```
    Random names were associated with user IDs for clearer and more human-readable data visualization.

### Data Processing Techniques

The data, sourced from Fitbit (Fitabase), presented potential biases due to its limitation to 30 participants. The third-party nature of the collection method further raised issues. Addressing these challenges required several processing techniques:

- Datetime formatting was changed for consistency.
- Heart rate data had to be resampling to a minute granularity, reducing the dataset's size for manageability.
- Feature engineering split date and time for clearer time-series data interpretation.
- Data cleaning saw the removal of non-essential columns and renaming for clarity e.g, logid column which had inconsistent data and didn't correlate across datasets.

### Opportunities from the Project

- Delve into the relationship between heart rate and sleep stages, offering insights into potential sleep stage predictions using Fitbit data.
- Acquire hands-on experience with real-world datasets.
- Improve understanding of time-series data.

### New Technologies Learned

- Practice with Pandas for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- Visualization techniques, particularly with Matplotlib.

### Datasets Explored

- **heartrate_seconds**: Captured heart rates every second.
- **minuteSleep**: Documented sleep metrics every minute.
- **minuteSteps**: Recorded steps metrics every minute.

### Skills Acquired

- Better understanding of time-series data analysis.
- Basic skills in data cleaning.
- Feature engineering within date-time data.
- Practise with visualization of time-series data.

### Challenges Faced

- Merging posed challenges due to the extensive dataset sizes, had many problems finding ways to merge data beneficially while staying coherent.
- Due to merging challenges and the limited number of participants, establishing a connection between the heart rate and sleep stages data proved to be incredibly frustrating.
- The MinuteSleep data was hard to differentiate between daytime and nighttime hours, making it either inaccurate or I struggled to interpret it correctly.
- Formatting on the steps data was also a challenge to interpret, along with having what seemed like a pointless column.
- Differing granularities between datasets causing resampling of datasets.
- The dataset's potential biases came from a limited participant count and third-party collection methods, eventhough datasets are large the data stays quite consistent.

### Modeling Roadblocks

Haven't begun modeling for Iteration 1.

## Conceptual Hurdles

- Have to get a better grasp on the aspects influencing sleep stages.
- Understading the relationship between heart rate and sleep aswell as physical activity on sleep, especially considering the inconsistencies present in the sleep data.
